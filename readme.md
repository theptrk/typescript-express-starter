# typescript-express-starter
The project used the `express (v4.16.0)` generator with the `ejs` option. 

Then typescript was introduced and the directories rescaffolded.

This project is purposely left feautre free to allow the forker to start fresh. 

Big thanks to Microsoft for typescript and the official starter

## run
```
$ npm ci      # you should be using `npm ci` for consistent builds
$ npm run dev # this will compile ts in watch mode and run nodemon 
```
